## DAO
- **WTF is a DAO?**
DAOs are an effective and safe way to work with like-minded folks around the globe. Think of them like an internet-native business that's collectively owned and managed by its members. They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice. There's no **CEO** who can authorize spending based on their own whims and no chance of a dodgy **CFO** manipulating the books. Everything is out in the open and the rules around spending are baked into the **DAO** via its code. You can learn more about DAOs here https://ethereum.org/en/dao/
